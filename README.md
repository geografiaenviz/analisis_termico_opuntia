Thermal Analysis of Opuntia Species in QuerÃ©taro, Mexico

This repository contains a comprehensive thermal tolerance analysis of Opuntia species (cacti/nopales) occurring in QuerÃ©taro, Mexico. The project integrates geospatial distribution data and surface temperature rasters to assess how different cactus species respond to heat across the region.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

Extract temperature values associated with each Opuntia species from geospatial datasets.

Compare thermal environments among species using statistical analysis (Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc).

Visualize temperature distributions with boxplots and density plots.

Classify species into thermal tolerance categories, such as highly heat-tolerant, moderately tolerant, sensitive, or highly sensitive.

Provide insights for ecology, conservation, and agroecology, especially regarding resilience to climate variability.


ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

R: ggplot2, dplyr, sf, raster, viridis, FSA

Spatial data processing: Extraction of raster values, handling of shapefiles.

Statistical analysis: Non-parametric tests for comparing thermal tolerance.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

Contributes to the biogeography and ecological characterization of Opuntia in central Mexico.

Supports studies on thermal resilience, climate adaptation, and conservation strategies for cactus species.

Provides baseline data for agroecological management of tuneras and related crops.

ðŸ”¹ Visualization Examples

Boxplots of species temperature distributions

Density plots of temperature exposure per species

Bar charts of thermal tolerance classification

This project serves as a bioinformatic and ecological reference for researchers, conservationists, and land managers interested in the thermal ecology of cacti in semiarid and subhumid regions of Mexico.
